You are reading README for the library pm, version 3.0.ru.0.

The library contains regular expressions, grammars, and other stuff for text parsing.

Deabbreviation of the library name: parse modules.

"ru" in the version means that the documentation (except this README) is in Russian. (!!!)

Pm is a C++ library (standard 14).

The library is distributed under GNU GPLv3 license.
The license text is placed in the file LICENSE in this folder.


= Prerequisites =

Library itself, obligatory:
- C++ compiler compliant with C++14 standard (or greater).
- "cmake" tool, version: at least 3.1.
 - Cmake is optional, though it is much easier to build the library with it.

Documentation:
- "doxygen" utility.
- "dot" utility (for graph generation in doxygen).
 - Those who are familiar with doxygen may eliminate "dot": disable graph generation in the configuration files "Doxyfile" and "doxygen_layout.xml" located in this folder.


= Getting started =

  cd <root>
  mkdir build
  doxygen Doxyfile

The main documentation page (at least in Linux) is:
  <root>/build/doc/index.html
